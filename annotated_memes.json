Many meme-generator websites have this template readily available.\n2. Construct a two-part piece of text. The first part, characteristically placed at the top of the image, introduces a relatively trivial, often stereotypically 'first world' situation. The second part, put at the bottom of the image, is presented as the boy's incredulous reaction or question to the situation.\n    - For example, the top text may read, \"You're telling me,\" with the bottom text completing the thought with something like \"you have clean water and you use it to clean cars?\" \n3. Ensure your text stands in stark contrast to conditions typically experienced in third world countries, playing on the premise that such minor issues would be viewed as luxuries from the boy's perspective.\n4. Remember to be respectful and culturally sensitive in your choice of text. Aim for humor, but not at the expense of ridiculing or belittling"
